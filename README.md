C:
On the outside interface it is a little confusing as to where the button is because it has a security label near it that makes it look like its for something else.
Inside it is mostly fine but all of the keyholes could be moved so that they are less mindflooding for the average person using it.

Most of the time you'll only use the button to call the elevator, the button to choose a floor, and occasionally the buttons to open/close the doors. On rare situations where the elevator breaks down you may need to select an emergency or help button. The interface is mostly fine but could be organized better so the main buttons are easier to find at a glance.

The normal sequence is call elevator, enter elevator, choose floor, exit elevator, shouldn't overcomplicate things.

The buttons should be labeled in an easy to understand way to show the function, for instance an up arrow on the button to indicate you want to go up, or a 2 to select the second floor.

This elevator dings when it opens for someone who called it and the buttons light up when selected.

It would be difficult to make mistakes but the way it is organized may cause you to think for a second or two longer than is necessary.

I think the extra stuff that isnt used by the average person should be moved/hidden to make it less cluttered and move the security label so its more obvious what its for.
